# Homework 4 Assignment Objectives

Task 1 for this homework assignment is practice with answering the types of questions that will be asked on the next exam.

Task 2 of the assignment involves writing R functions manually create functions that generate the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Deviation (MAE) given a set of response values.

Task 3 of the assignment focuses on querying an API and writing a function that queries the API and

##Task 1: Conceptual Questions

1.  What is the purpose of the lapply() function? What is the equivalent purrr function?

    > The purpose `lapply()` is to apply a function to all variables in a data frame. lapply`treats the variables in data frames as a list, and applies a called function to all objects in the list.  The equivalent purrr function to`lapply`is`map()\`.

2.  Suppose we have a list called my_list. Each element of the list is a numeric data frame (all columns are numeric). We want use lapply() to run the code cor(numeric_matrix, method = "kendall") on each element of the list. Write code to do this below! (Iâ€™m really trying to ask you how you specify method = "kendall" when calling lapply())

    > lapply(df, cor(numeric_matrix, method = "kendall"))

3.  What are two advantages of using purrr functions instead of the BaseR apply family?

    > `map()` requires less coding to use

4.  What is a side-effect function?

    > Answer

5.  Why can you name a variable sd in a function and not cause any issues with the sd function?

    > The sd() function is global throughout R (via R packages) while sd is a temporary variable that is local to the funciton it is in. Once the code is finished running, the variable sd does not exist.
